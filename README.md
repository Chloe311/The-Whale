# the-whale

The Whale is an interactive installation to encourage people to use less plastic and protect the environment.

Goal: 
Plastic pollution has become a major and unavoidable issue. Every bit of plastic in our lives has the potential to poison the ocean. To avoid further mutilation of marine life, I call on people to use less plastic and to protect the ecology and wildlife through an interactive installation.
